## Who Am I?
<br>
I am Abrek, a localization warlock and game industry newbie.
<br><br>
I am proficient at:
<br><br>

- Game/Website/App Localization
- Localization Project Management
- Localization Engineering (File Formats, Automation, Database Maintenance etc.)
- Subtitling
<br><br>

I am not quite proficient at (but trying hard):
<br><br>

- Unity (Other tools are scary, at least I know what's going on in this one...)
- Game Design
- Creative Management
- Product Management

#### I crawl through indie works to find games and write stuff about them.
It's mostly to learn more about game design and to better improve my writing skills on gaming industry. You can find my Medium blog below.
