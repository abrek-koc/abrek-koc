## Who Am I?
<br>
I am Abrek, a localization warlock and game industry newbie.
<br><br>
I am proficient at:
<br><br>

- Game/Website/App Localization
- Localization Project Management
- Localization Engineering (File Formats, Automation, Database Maintenance etc.)
- Subtitling
<br><br>

I am not quite proficient at (but trying hard):
<br><br>

- Unity (Other tools are scary, at least I know what's going on in this one...)
- Game Design
- Creative Management
- Product Management

### Now as a  hobby, I crawl through indie works to find games and write stuff about them. You can reach out to my Medium blog below.
